# PrairieRun extension

## Current functionality

- Scans the logged-in `us.prairielearn.com` home page and discovered course assessment pages.
- Automatically scans when the logged-in PrairieLearn home page is opened.
- Automatically synchronizes actionable assignments to Google Calendar after each scan.
- Reconciles stored assignments with Google Calendar at least once every 24 hours, even when they have not changed.
- Extracts assignments, course names, scores, source URLs, due timestamps, and time zones.
- Merges base assessments and numbered assessment instances.
- Stores assignments locally in Chrome.
- Shows an embedded assignment panel directly below the PrairieLearn course links, grouped by class.
- Shows assignments due today or later; older assignments remain untouched in Google Calendar.
- Shows the next three uncompleted assignments, with additional upcoming work and completed work in separate dropdowns.
- Uses PrairieLearn completion status and the strict-greater-than-95% score rule.
- Sorts incomplete assignments first and puts completed assignments in a dropdown.
- Adds a Google Calendar popup reminder to each uncompleted assignment; the default lead time is four hours and can be changed in the extension popup. Completed assignments have reminders removed.
- Keeps undated assignments hidden by default, with an extension setting to reveal them.
- Lets the user add or edit a due date for an undated assignment from the embedded panel.
- Previews one-hour calendar blocks ending at the due time.

## Load and test

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Choose **Load unpacked**.
4. Select this `extension` directory.
5. Log in to `https://us.prairielearn.com/`.
6. Review the assignment panel below the PrairieLearn course links. Scanning and Calendar synchronization start automatically.

## Firefox (same codebase, generated manifest)

The extension runs in Firefox 121+ with full functionality: PrairieLearn
scan, embedded home panel, popup, and automatic Google Calendar sync. The
only per-browser delta is the manifest, generated from
`extension/manifest.base.json`:

```bash
# Chrome/Brave manifest (regenerates extension/manifest.json)
node build-manifest.js --target=chrome

# Firefox distribution directory (stable add-on ID included)
node build-manifest.js --target=firefox
```

Then, for development:

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Choose **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select any file inside `dist-firefox/` (e.g. `dist-firefox/manifest.json`).
4. Log in to `https://us.prairielearn.com/` and verify scan → panel →
   Calendar sync as in Chrome.

For distribution beyond development, the build must be signed through
addons.mozilla.org (AMO); see `google-calendar-setup.md` for the separate
Firefox Google OAuth client this requires. Pass `--gecko-id=` to
`build-manifest.js` to stamp a permanent add-on ID you own before
submitting to AMO.

## Google Calendar export

The extension is configured for the PrairieRun development OAuth client and requests Calendar access when the first actionable assignment is synchronized. On the first export, Chrome will ask the signed-in Google account for consent. Synchronization creates or reuses a `PrairieLearn — {class}` calendar and stores a private assignment marker plus Google event ID for duplicate-safe updates.

For a different extension ID or a published build, create a matching Chrome Extension OAuth client and update `manifest.json` before loading the extension.
